# Stream events

> This command is for broadcaster only

The `!event` command gives broadcasters the ability to manage events for streams.

## Event types
+ live
+ offline
+ title
+ category
+ custom

## Syntax

### Create a new event
`!event on <name>:<type> <message...>`
+ `<name>` - Twitch username or event name *(custom type only)*.
+ `<type>` - [Event type](#event-types).
+ `<message>` - The message that will be sent with the event.

> Events with types *category* and *title* use *{0}* and *{1}* placeholders for old and new values respectively. This means that the bot can show changes if you set them (e.g. *forsen changed the title from **{0}** to **{1}*** will replace with *forsen changed the title from **Just Chatting** to **PUBG***).

### Delete the event
`!event off <name>:<type>`
+ `<name>` - Twitch username or event name *(custom type only)*.
+ `<type>` - [Event type](#event-types).

### Call the event

> The bot requires moderator privileges on events with the **"massping"** flag.

`!event call <name>:<type>`
+ `<name>` - Twitch username or event name *(custom type only)*.
+ `<type>` - [Event type](#event-types).
