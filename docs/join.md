# How do I make the bot join my chat?

## Join using the `!join` command:

To invite the bot to your Twitch channel,
**the streamer** must use the `!join` command **ONLY** in [the bot's chat](https://twitch.tv/teabot).
Once this command is executed, the bot will join the channel and users can use its commands.

## Join via the website:
