# How do I make the bot join my chat?

## Join using the `!join` command:

To invite the bot to your Twitch channel,
the streamer or moderator must use the `!join` command **ONLY** in [the bot's chat](https://twitch.tv/imteabot).
Once this command is executed, the bot will join the channel and users can use its commands.

## Join via the website:

In addition to the chat command, the user can also use [the website](/join).
This involves logging in through Twitch account and
after that the user can add the bot to their channel or where they are moderating.

> Logging in through the website will open up many features that will not open up when using `!join`.
